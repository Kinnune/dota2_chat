# DotA2 chat commands!
WIP-project, goal is to emulate dota 2's chat enviroment inside users shell. 
This project was build mainly for the need to random a hero after the 2nd pick. 
To start: run "build.sh" inside build. 
This scheme relies on running small programs to print the chat log. 
Try running "help" in the project root.
