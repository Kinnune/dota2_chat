# DotA2 chat commands!
Goal of this project is to emulate dota 2's chat enviroment inside users shell. 
This project was built mainly for the need to random a hero after the 2nd pick.
To start: "make" libft.a inside libft. 
Then : run "build.sh" inside build. 
This scheme relies on running small programs to print the chat log. 
Try ./help in the emulator directory.
Please give the rand function a second or so to update.
